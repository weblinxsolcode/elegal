                  Being laid off can be a stressful experience, especially if you don't fully understand your severance package. Unfortunately, many employees sign the agreement they are given without realizing that it can be negotiable. However, taking the time to understand your severance package and determine if it can be negotiated is crucial. Doing so can ensure you receive the best possible terms and benefits during this challenging time.

                    When negotiating a severance package, departing employees often think they need more leverage and accept whatever their employer offers. However, this is a fallacy that employers often take advantage of. Departing employees have more power than they think. A severance agreement can serve as an insurance policy for the employer against future employment-related claims and disruptive litigation that could cost the organization significantly more financial and reputational costs than a severance package would. For example, suppose an employee has potential claims against the employer for discrimination, harassment, or wrongful termination. In that case, the employer may want to negotiate a more generous severance package that includes the employee's release and forfeiture of any potential claims against the employer.

                  However, employees may not be aware that they have a potential employment-related claim, as employers are unlikely to admit to illegal conduct in their reasoning for termination. This is why it's essential to consult an employment lawyer experienced in severance negotiations before agreeing to any severance package. Unlike the employee, the employer negotiates severance packages all the time and undoubtedly has an attorney to provide advice throughout the process. Having your lawyer even the playing field can help identify potential claims and pressure points to use to your advantage.
